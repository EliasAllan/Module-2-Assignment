# Accesibility code refactor

## Description

This is a portoflio for a Upenn bootcamp student. It's designed to consolidate what was learned in module 2, and it serves as a personal portfolio for the student after the program is completed. The placeholder images are to be filled later on with actual projects made by the students.

## Overview

Click the links on the navigator to go the the respective sections.
